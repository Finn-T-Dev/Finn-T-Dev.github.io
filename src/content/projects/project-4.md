I created a power grid simulation in which users can plug/unplug/switch on/switch off electrical devices in a simple home simulation, and have the changes reflected in real-time power usage. Also simulated the impact of a solar energy system with a dynamically variable number of solar panels, enabling the user to see how much power was being generated and utilised by each source.
